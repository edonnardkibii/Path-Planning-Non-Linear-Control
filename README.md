## Path-Planning-Non-Linear-Control

Control of mobile systems. Most notable driver assistant systems, e.g. for parking, evasive maneuvers, autonomous driving.

### Topics covered
• Kinematic models, path planning, nonlinear control  
• Theoretical foundation and algorithms are provided.  
• Implementing and test the algorithms within the Matlab/Simulink framework.
